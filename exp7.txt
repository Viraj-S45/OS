SJF (Shortest Job First):
o This algorithm associates with each process the length of the processâ€™s next
CPU burst. When the CPU is available, it is assigned to the process that has the
smallest next CPU burst. If the next CPU bursts of two processes are same,
FCFS is used to break the tie.
o It is also called shortest next CPU burst algorithm or shortest remaining time
first scheduling.
o It is provably optimal, in that it gives the minimum average waiting time for a
given set of processes.
o The real difficulty with SJF knows the length of the next CPU request.
o It can be either PREEMPTIVE (SRTF- Shortest Remaining Time First) or
NON-PREEMPTIVE.

SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling
1. Start
2. Accept no. of processes from user.
3. Accept burst time of each process i.e BT[i].
4. Sort the processes according to ascending order of burst time.
5. Initialize waiting time of first process = 0 i.e. (WT[1])=0.
6. For(i=2;i<=n;i++)
7. WT[i]=WT[i-1]+BT[i-1]
8. End of for loop
9. Calculate average waiting time= (Total Waiting Time) / No. of Processes
10. End
