fork() System Call

The fork() system call creates a new process in UNIX. It takes no arguments and returns a process ID (pid_t).

Behavior of fork() return values:
- Negative value: Fork failed.
- Zero: Returned to the newly created child process.
- Positive value: Returned to the parent process with the childâ€™s process ID.

The parent and child processes have separate address spaces but initially contain identical copies of the program.
