FCFS (First-Come, First-Served):
o It is the simplest algorithm and NON-PREEMPTIVE.
o The process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first.
o The implementation is easily managed by queue. When a process enters the
ready queue, its PCB is linked onto the tail of the queue. When the CPU is free,
it is allocated to the process at the head of the queue
o The average waiting time, however, is long. It is not minimal and may vary
substantially if the processâ€™s CPU burst time varies greatly.
o This algorithm is particularly troublesome for time-sharing systems.

FCFS Scheduling
1. Start
2. Accept no. of processes from user.
3. Accept burst time of each process i.e BT[i].
4. Initialize waiting time of P1=0 i.e. (WT[1])=0.
5. For(i=2;i<=n;i++)
6. WT[i]=WT[i-1]+BT[i-1]
7. End of for loop
8. Calculate average waiting time= (Total Waiting Time) / No. of Processes
9. End
