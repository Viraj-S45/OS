PRIORITY SCHEDULING:
o The SJF is a special case of priority scheduling.
o In priority scheduling algorithm, a priority is associated with each process, and
the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority.
o It can be either PREEMPTIVE or NON-PREEMPTIVE
o A major problem with priority scheduling algorithms is indefinite blocking, or
starvation.
o A solution to starvation is AGING. It is a technique of gradually increasing the
priority of process that wait in the system for long time.

Priority Scheduling
1. Start
2. Accept no. of processes from user.
3. Accept burst time and priority of each process i.e BT[i].
4. Sort the processes and burst time according to ascending order of priority.
5. Initialize waiting time of first process = 0 i.e. (WT[1])=0.
6. For(i=2;i<=n;i++)
7. WT[i]=WT[i-1]+BT[i-1]
8. End of for loop
9. Calculate average waiting time= (Total Waiting Time) / No. of Processes
10. End
